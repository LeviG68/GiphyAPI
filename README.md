# Giphy API
The horse in my garage and other stories about Giphy.

Working with API's and why not Giphy. Gained access to Giphy via their API, creating gif buttons from self generated subject area. WIth each button it will show you 10 gifs with start and stop functionality and a rating for each gif.

Don't forget to gif responsible!
